# 8.04 Activity 2

Connect to the **SkyScanner** API and extract information from all the flights flying from Munich to Berlin. To do that you will need to get their _city ID_ which you can find in the first query we used in the lesson. In this activity you will just need to create a function called `city_code` that takes a `city_name`(_string-like_, _"Mumbai"_) as a parameter and returns the city flight code.
