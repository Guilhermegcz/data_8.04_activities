# 8.04 Activity 3

Create a function called `flight_prices`that takes `departure` (as the origin city name, "Mumbai"), `arrival`(as the destination city name, "Istanbul") and `date`. It should return an output similar to the one we had for San Francisco - New York. You may want to check if it works with these param values:

- Departure: "Berlin"
- Arrival: "Vienna"
- Date: "2020-10-03" (The format will help but remember that it has to be an upcoming date)
